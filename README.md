🚀Hi there! Some React Native Mobile App Here 🚀

📁 Check out my repository showcasing a React Native CLI mobile app! This project flaunts a single infinite scroll-screen powered by React Query state management using useInfiniteQuery. While it might lack unit-test coverage, it's a fantastic demo to explore key features:

🔄 Infinite Scroll Screen
🧠 State Management with React Query Cache

Here's a sneak peek at the tech stack:

    React Native 0.72.7
    React 18.2.0
    React Query 5.10.0
    Navigation via React Navigation 6.1.9
    And a bunch more!

⚙️ To get started:
1️⃣ Run yarn to install dependencies.
2️⃣ Execute yarn android to fire up the emulator or connect to a physical device via USB debugging.

Remember, this project isn't focused on top-notch UI/UX—it's purely a demonstration of functionality.
